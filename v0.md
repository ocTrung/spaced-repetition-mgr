general idea:
- this works like the event queue in javascript engines
- the scheduler gives a task an interval which is essentially a date in the future when the task should be done
- we can use this date to order these tasks in a task queue
- the user can then periodically check this queue the same way the event loop periodically checks the event task queue
- q1: where do user's like to check for tasks? How do they want to be 'looped in'?
    - email?
    - calendar?
    - that apps own queue?
- q2: when and how often should these messages appear?
    - when: week of, day of, X days before
